"""Per-server bridge host — the child process that does the actual elevation.

One bridge host == one FastMCP proxy in front of one stdio MCP server, served over
Streamable HTTP at ``/mcp`` by its own uvicorn on a loopback port. Running each
server in its own process gives fault isolation (a hung/crashing server can't take
down the control plane or its peers) and a real PID/port for supervision.

The control plane resolves the runner -> a literal ProcessSpec, then launches this
module as a subprocess, passing the spec + port via environment variables:

    MCPE_BRIDGE_SPEC  JSON: {command, args, env, cwd, name, transport, mcp_http, rest_openapi}
    MCPE_BRIDGE_HOST  loopback host (default 127.0.0.1)
    MCPE_BRIDGE_PORT  port to listen on

``transport`` selects the upstream: ``stdio`` (spawn command/args) or
``streamable-http`` / ``sse`` (front a remote URL; ``command`` is the URL and ``env``
is the upstream HTTP headers).

Session isolation: ``FastMCP.as_proxy(transport)`` gives a fresh upstream session
per request (no cross-client context mixing). "Sharing one subprocess" means
sharing this process + the package install across the MCP and (later) REST
surfaces — never a single shared MCP session.

The REST/OpenAPI surface is added in M6; this M1 version serves MCP only.

    An upstream MCP server may ask its client — here, this proxy — to list the

    But many MCP clients (Claude.ai, and anything that connects without declaring
